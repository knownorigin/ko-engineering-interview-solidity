# NFT Drop

### Task

- Write an NFT smart contract extending either the **ERC721** or **ERC1155** standard
- The contract should allow anyone to mint the following conditions:
  - Each token has a fixed price of **0.01 ETH** per token
  - Users can mint up to **3 NFTs maximum** per address
  - Minting should only be possible for **1 week** from a certain date
- Try to include a unit test for the mint function

### Stretch Goals
- We want to enable a defined set of wallets to mint a token for free
- We want to enable batch purchases of up to 5 tokens from a single address in one transaction
- GAS golfing
